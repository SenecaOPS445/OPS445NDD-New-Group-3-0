# Winter 2025 Assignment 2
# mzaman30 (CLI & Main Flow)

## Overview:
I worked on the **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and **main program flow** of the assignment.
This includes setting up user inputs for the **sampling interval** (`--interval`) and **output location** (`--output`).

### Key Features:
- **`--interval`**: Sets the time between CPU usage samples (default: 2 seconds).
- **`--output`**: Specifies where to save the reports (default: "Reports").
